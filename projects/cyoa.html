            <h1 class="margin text-center"> Cooking Food!</h1>
            <p>My project was about cooking or more like food. My project was like a normal food routine, you can pick you would like to have breakfast, lunch or dinner. Whichever you would want to pick. Some of them may make you end up going to the hospitial or possbile death so I would rather you to pick wisely. My parthers are Kiara, and Vanessa. They are great parnters to work with during the time being of being together but sometimes it may have lead to confusion and we all may not be able to understand what is that other one is trying to say. We overcome this situition by like resolving the problem and trying to like try to make us less stress. We talked it out and even though it may have taken a while, we were able to make it work. I would say that we would have added more but sometimes, the ide wouldn't work and which it would make the it more stressful or fun at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>The project that we had done together was kinda challenging but that the same time, it was fun. I enjoyed it a lot when i was working with them. They made things fun and sometimes when they needed help, we could like help each other. It was very nice to know that we can do everything together.</p>
